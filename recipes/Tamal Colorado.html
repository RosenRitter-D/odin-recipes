    <p>
      Tamales colorados are very traditional in Guatemala. The dish is prepared
      for all kinds of occasions, but especially for celebrations. Unlike the
      traditional Mexican tamal, this typical Guatemalan dish is wrapped in
      fresh banana leaves.

        pumpkin seed, cinnamon, annatto and salt.
      </li>
      <li>

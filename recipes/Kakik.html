    <p>
      Kak'ik is known as caldo colorado de pavo o chunto, traditional from
      Cob√°n. The word Kak'ik is of Mayan origin and means red and chili, for
      each respective syllable. This dish is always served with rice to add to
      the broth and small tamales of corn dough seasoned with nothing but salt,
      which are called blancos or pochitos.
